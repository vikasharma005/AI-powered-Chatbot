# AI-powered Chatbot for Customer Service using Python and WhatsApp

This repository contains the code for an AI-powered chatbot that provides customer service support using Python and WhatsApp.

## Requirements

- Twilio account

- Python environment with the following libraries installed:

  - Twilio

  - ChatterBot

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. Set up a Twilio account and get a Twilio number for WhatsApp.

3. Create a Python environment and install the required libraries.

4. Train the ChatterBot model with a set of customer service questions and answers.

5. Deploy the Python script on a cloud-based server, such as Heroku or AWS, to make it accessible over the internet.

6. Connect the Twilio number to the Python script, so that incoming messages are automatically forwarded to the chatbot.

7. Test the chatbot by sending messages from WhatsApp to the Twilio number.

## Code Explanation

The code uses the Twilio library to receive incoming messages from WhatsApp, and the ChatterBot library to respond to those messages using AI. The ChatterBot model is trained with a set of customer service questions and answers, to help it provide accurate and helpful responses. The code also includes a main function that runs the chatbot, and receives and responds to messages in an infinite loop.
